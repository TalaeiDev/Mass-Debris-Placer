# Mass Debris Placer

Hello everyone, I wanted to share a tool I made in unity3D, you can use this tool to place mass debris within unity 3D with just a few clicks and then combine mesh and save mesh with generated lightmap UV on your project folder.

Features  :

- The Debris Prefab will be loaded from the folder path you specify in the project menu and stored in the array.

- There are options for the number of debris objects, random size between two numbers, and area radius for generating debris objects.

- If debris is not combined yet, it can be clear and generate debris again .

-  A option for fix debris placement after generate with remove rigidbody, but keep colliders for objects.

-  Combine mesh for better performance and decrease draw call, and then save the mesh in the project folder

-  There are option for generate lightmap UVs for the combined mesh if you wish to bake the scene.

Note : This tool uses Unity physics in editor to drop debris on the ground after it is generated. 

Thank you, and I would appreciate if you could give your feedback about this tool.
